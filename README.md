## üîß Configuration  

### 1. **Prompts (`prompts.txt`)**  
Store your rotating prompts in a simple text file:  
- File Path: `~/automations/prompts.txt`  
- Format: Each line represents a new prompt.

Example `prompts.txt`:  
```
Take a walk and stretch.
Drink water. You're not a cactus.
Focus on one thing at a time.
```

### 2. **Config (`config.json`)**  
Define your extension settings in a JSON file.  
- File Path: `~/automations/config.json`  

Example `config.json`:  
```json
{
    "textColor": "#0fbaba",
    "timeout": 30,
    "offlineEmoji": "‚ùå"
}
```

## üìú Extension Behavior  

1. **Dynamic Prompt Updates**  
   The extension reads lines from your `prompts.txt` file and cycles through them at the interval defined in `config.json`.  

2. **Customization via Config**  
   - The text color is applied dynamically using `config.textColor`.  
   - The rotation interval (`config.timeout`) determines how often prompts change.

3. **Offline Handling**  
   - The extension will detect if it's unable to read the `config.json` file (e.g., due to network issues).  
   - In offline mode, prompts are prefixed with an emoji, such as ‚ùóÔ∏è, to let you know something needs attention.

---

### Dependencies  
- **GNOME Shell**: Tested on GNOME 40+.  
- **GLib and Gio APIs**: For file handling and network monitoring.

### Key Logic Highlights  
- Reads local files (`prompts.txt` and `config.json`) using GLib.
- Handles network availability using the **Gio.NetworkMonitor** API.
- Updates the GNOME panel dynamically with the **Mainloop.timeout_add_seconds** function.
